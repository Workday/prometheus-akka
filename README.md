# prometheus-akka

This project is a fork of [Kamon-Akka](http://kamon.io/documentation/kamon-akka/0.6.6/overview/). The Kamon team have done a great job and if you are just experimenting with metrics collection, then their tools and documentation are a great starting point. 
Our internal monitoring tools work better with [Prometheus Java Client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java) based metrics than with [Kamon](http://kamon.io/documentation/get-started/) based metrics.
The use of the [Kamon-Prometheus](https://github.com/MonsantoCo/kamon-prometheus) bridge was not as smooth as we had hoped.

Other Differences from Kamon-Akka:
- we do not support Kamon TraceContexts, as we currently have no use case for them
- we only support Scala 2.11 and Scala 2.12
- we only build with Akka 2.4 but we test the build with Akka 2.5 too
- we have added Actor Group support (similar support was recently added to kamon-akka) - see description in Metrics section
- records time in seconds as opposed to nanoseconds (the data is still a double) - since 0.8.0

```sbt
"com.workday" %% "prometheus-akka" % "0.8.3"
```

There is a sample project at https://github.com/pjfanning/prometheus-akka-sample

[Release Notes](https://github.com/Workday/prometheus-akka/releases)

## Usage

To enable monitoring, include the appropriate jar as a dependency and include the following Java runtime flag in your Java startup command (aspectjweaver is a transitive dependency of prometheus-akka):

-javaagent:/path/to/aspectjweaver-1.8.13.jar

If you don't have a Prometheus Metrics endpoint already, you can use the [Prometheus MetricsServlet](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/blob/master/simpleclient_servlet/src/main/java/io/prometheus/client/exporter/MetricsServlet.java). If you don't want to use a servlet, you can work directly with the [Prometheus TextFormat](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/blob/master/simpleclient_common/src/main/java/io/prometheus/client/exporter/common/TextFormat.java) class.

## Configuration

The metrics are configured using [application.conf](https://github.com/typesafehub/config) files. There is a default [reference.conf](https://github.com/Workday/prometheus-akka/blob/master/src/main/resources/reference.conf) that enables only some metrics.

### Metrics

#### Dispatcher

- differs a little between ForkJoin dispatchers and ThreadPool dispatchers
- ForkJoin: parallelism, activeThreadCount, runningThreadCount, queuedSubmissionCount, queuedTaskCountGauge stealCount
- ThreadPool: activeThreadCount, corePoolSize, currentPoolSize, largestPoolSize, maxPoolSize, completedTaskCount, totalTaskCount

#### Actor System

- Only added in v0.8.2
- Actor Count
- Unhandled Message Count
- Dead Letter Count

#### Actor

- One metric per actor instance
- mailboxSize (current size), processingTime, timeInMailbox, message count, error count

#### Actor Router

- One metric per router instance, summed across all routee actors
- routingTime, timeInMailbox, message count, error count

#### Actor Group

- Each actor group has its own include/exclude rules and you can define many groups with individual actors being allowed to be included in many groups - the metrics are summed across all actors in the group
- actorCount (current active actors), mailboxSize (current size), processingTime, timeInMailbox, message count, error count
